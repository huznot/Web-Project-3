                <p>
                    Treaty One was signed between the Crown and indigenous people living in the area now denoted as Treaty One.
                    It involved seven First Nation tribes whom agreed to divide land with European settlers in return for promises
                    and terms. Some promises made by the Crown to the indigenous people included giving 160 acres of land for every
                    family of five, with adjustments for smaller or largerfamilies; building and maintaining a school on each reserve;
                    paying each family of five $15, with proportional amounts for different family sizes; and reserving specific areas
                    of land exclusively for the First Nations living there. The aim of the treaty for the settlers was to permit European
                    settlers into the lands of the Indigenous people for farming, settlement, and resource development, which was ultimately
                    succesful however promises with the indigenous people were broken many times.
